## Laboratory 1 - Introduction to Java Programming

## The tasks can be divided in three categories: compulsory, homework and bonus

### Compulsory

***

Created a project which models a real architecture of a room-event model. Created classes Event, Room, Main and the 
Enum RoomType. The Room class should have a name, capacity and a type from the enum, whereas the Events class should have a name,
nrOfParticipants, startTime, and endTime. Each class should have a constructor, getters and setters. Events and Room class
override the method toString, using the shortcut "toString" and then pressing Ctrl+Space. 

Created and printed instances for the program.

### Homework

***

In the homework I created the classes Solution, Problem.
Overriden the equals method form the Object class for the Event, Room classes and added the constraint of not being able to add the same event or room twice.
Instead of using an enum, created dedicated classes for lecture halls and computer labs. Room became abstract. The course room now has an additional property indicating if there is a video projector, and the lab room indicates the operating system of its computers. The default operating system, if not assigned, is Windows.
Implemented a simple geedy algorithm for creating a feasible solution to the problem, "trying" to minimize the number of used rooms.
Written doc comments in my source code and generated the class documentation using javadoc.

### Bonus

***

Used the time package in order to describe the start and the end time of the events.
Implemented partially the DSatur graph coloring algorithm.
Generated large random instances and compared the solutions generated by Greedy and DSatur algorithms +
analyzed the performance on my algorithm (running times, memory consumption). 
Had problems in the implementation of DSatur.

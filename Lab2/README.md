## Laboratory 2 - The Room Assignment Problem

## The tasks can be divided in three categories: compulsory, homework and bonus

### Compulsory

***

Created a project which models a real architecture of a room-event model. Created classes Event, Room, Main and the 
Enum RoomType. The Room class should have a name, capacity and a type from the enum, whereas the Events class should have a name,
nrOfParticipants, startTime, and endTime. Each class should have a constructor, getters and setters. Events and Room class
override the method toString, using the shortcut "toString" and then pressing Ctrl+Space. 

Created and printed instances for the program.
